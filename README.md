# simple-java-maven-app

#This repository is for the
#[Build a Java app with Maven](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/)
#tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

#The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
@"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
m@ain application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JU@nit XML report.
@
T@he `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
yo@u'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `jenkins/scripts` subdirectory
con@tains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the @"Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
